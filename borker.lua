--[[ 

This is an experimental playground for creating Phrases, deriving Words
from those Phrases, and establishing the "Borkness" of a word or 
phrase.

A word or phrase is to be considered 'borked' if there is not an 
existing definition for that word or phrase in the Phrases table.

This way an initial corpus can be fed, analyzed, and a glosssary
or dictionary can be created, with the potential of creating a
corpus which has full definitions for each word or phrase - i.e. zero bork.

An initial 'nonsense' Latin corpus is used, just for fun.  The
completeness of this corpus, its bork, will evolve with the project.

'dict' is considered as a means of resolving bork, but some work 
must still be done on getting a proper definition from 'dict', 
which does not introduce Yet More Borkâ„¢.

This is a fun project, don't take it seriously.  If you find it
inspiring in the fight against your own bork, please contribute.
